AutoCorrect Tool
📝 Overview
This project is a command-line autocorrect tool that provides spelling suggestions for misspelled words. Built with Python, it uses natural language processing (NLP) principles to generate a list of likely corrections for a given word and ranks them based on their frequency in a large text corpus. This tool is a great example of how basic NLP techniques can be used to solve common problems like typos.

🚀 Features
Vocabulary Building: Automatically creates a vocabulary of correctly spelled words from a text file.

Correction Generation: Implements a simple but effective algorithm to generate all possible one-edit-away words (deletions, transpositions, insertions, and replacements).

Probabilistic Ranking: Ranks the suggested corrections based on their frequency to provide the most probable correct word.

User-Friendly Interface: A simple command-line interface for entering words and receiving instant corrections.

🛠️ Installation
To get a local copy of this project up and running, follow these steps.

Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher

pip (Python package installer)

Setup
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/autocorrect-tool.git
cd autocorrect-tool
Create and activate a virtual environment:

Bash

python -m venv .venv
# On Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
Install the required libraries:
The project uses a few common libraries for data processing.

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare the corpus data:
Place your large text file (e.g., big.txt) in the project's root directory. This file will be used to build the vocabulary and train the frequency model.

🖥️ Usage
To run the autocorrect tool, simply execute the main Python script from your terminal.

Run the script:

Bash

python autocorrect.py
Enter a word:
The script will prompt you to enter a word. Type a word, even a misspelled one, and press Enter.

View suggestions:
The tool will then display the top suggestions, ranked from most to least likely.
